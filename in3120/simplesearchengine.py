class SimpleSearchEngine:
    """
    Realizes a simple query evaluator that efficiently performs N-of-M matching over an inverted index.
    I.e., if the query contains M unique query terms, each document in the result set should contain at
    least N of these m terms. For example, 2-of-3 matching over the query 'orange apple banana' would be
    logically equivalent to the following predicate:

       (orange AND apple) OR (orange AND banana) OR (apple AND banana)

    Note that N-of-M matching can be viewed as a type of "soft AND" evaluation, where the degree of match
    can be smoothly controlled to mimic either an OR evaluation (1-of-M), or an AND evaluation (M-of-M),
    or something in between.

    The evaluator uses the client-supplied ratio T = N/M as a parameter as specified by the client on a
    per query basis. For example, for the query 'john paul george ringo' we have M = 4 and a specified
    threshold of T = 0.7 would imply that at least 3 of the 4 query terms have to be present in a matching
    document.

        unique terms, a document is considered to be a match if it contains at least N <= M of those terms.

        The matching documents, if any, are ranked by the supplied ranker, and only the "best" matches are yielded
        back to the client as dictionaries having the keys "score" (float) and "document" (Document).
